Public speaking can be a daunting challenge, but it's also an incredibly rewarding one. When you're able to connect with your audience and share your knowledge and passion, it's an amazing feeling. But even if you're a seasoned public speaker, there's always room for improvement.

In this article, I will share 10 tips I wish I knew before getting on the tech stage for the first time. I hope they will inspire you to make your first tech talk debut.

## 1. You will never feelÂ prepared

Whether you're presenting a new speech or one you've given before, it's common to feel the urge to do better. Accept this feeling as a natural part of the process and concentrate on delivering your best performance.

## 2. Minimize theÂ risks

To minimize unnecessary stress, take control of what you can. Charge your devices, do a dry run of your presentation, and confirm that you have all the required adapters and equipment. Even small details can have a significant impact!

## 3. The audience is here to supportÂ you

Always keep in mind that your audience is rooting for you to do well. So, make sure to interact with them, include them in your presentation, and draw energy from their positivity to enhance your performance. Remember, they are your supporters!

## 4. The audience size does notÂ matter

Speaking in front of 15 people or 200 can evoke similar feelings. It's important not to let the number of people intimidate you. Instead, concentrate on creating a personal connection with each individual and delivering valuable information, regardless of the size of the audience.

## 5. There is no such thing as an oldÂ talk

Always remember that every audience is unique, even if you have given the same talk before. You may be surprised by how many individuals find your topic to be fresh and intriguing. Keep spreading your knowledge and sharing your experiences!

## 6. Storytelling >Â Content

Although content plays a crucial role, your story is what truly connects with your audience. Therefore, it's essential to develop a powerful message and allow it to shine through. Utilize your content to bolster and enrich your storytelling.

## 7. Do not pretend to know everything

It is completely acceptable to acknowledge when you do not possess all the answers. Display humility and be willing to delve further into topics. Welcome the chance for meaningful discussions and gaining knowledge from others.

## 8. CollectÂ feedback

Getting feedback is crucial for improving your public speaking skills. You can gather feedback by providing a form or survey after your talk. To make it easy for people to access, consider including a QR code on your final slide. Remember to view feedback as an opportunity to improve and grow as a speaker.

## 9. BeÂ yourself

When speaking in public, it's crucial to stay true to yourself. Avoid pretending to be someone you're not, as your listeners will notice. Speak in your usual manner, using everyday words and phrases. Don't dress up too much to feel comfortable. Just be sincere and genuine, and your audience will connect with you on a more profound level.

## 10. Have fun!Â ðŸŽ‰

Above all, remember to enjoy the experience of speaking at conferences and meetups. If public speaking is not your primary job, relish the opportunity to share your knowledge and passion. Although it may feel nerve-wracking at first, the rewarding feeling afterwards will make you immensely proud.
